# About VibeCheck

## Project Background

VibeCheck was created as part of a Machine Learning Applications course project at Georgetown University. The goal is to help people discover restaurants based on their visual aesthetics rather than just food reviews.

## Team

- **Manav Arora**
- **Jessica Joy**
- **Ping Hill**
- **Kristin Lloyd**
- **Viviana Luccioli**

## Motivation

Traditional restaurant recommendation systems focus primarily on food quality and service. VibeCheck takes a different approach by recognizing that the atmosphere and visual aesthetic of a restaurant are crucial factors in choosing where to dine.

## Technology

VibeCheck leverages:

- **Computer Vision** for image analysis
- **Machine Learning** for similarity matching
- **Web Scraping** for data collection
- **Modern Python** tools and best practices
